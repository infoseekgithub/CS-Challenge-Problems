Set the board according to the state that just polled out from the queue. 
Unlike DFS, the states are not continuous evolving, but jumps from branch to branch.

Therefore we need a way to store the board status in queue and poll it out when needed.
We use a List to store the board status and call it snapshot.

Once we have a way to store and bring back the board status, solving the problem with BFS
can be done.
