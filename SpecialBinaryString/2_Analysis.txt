Problem Analysis of Special Binary String


Given a special binary string, return a revised string that swap any two
consecutive substrings that are both special substring. The resulting string
should have the largest lexicographical value.
i.e. More 1's before 0's.  110010 is larger than 101100

A special binary string may contain one ore more substrings that special binary
strings. Starting character must be '1'.

Search from the next char after '1' until we see an unmatched '0', at which time
we found a full enclosing section that is special binary string.
        
During this procedure, we recursively call to process the section's substrings
and store the section's substrings in a list, and sort the list based on 
lexicographical order.

Then we return the revised version of the section to its caller.

The given string could include a combination of a few substrings that are speical
binary strings. Therefore we need to process the given string to its full length,
and we may get a single string or a list of strings. Again, sorte the list
lexicographically as needed.
