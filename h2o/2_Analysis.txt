Analysis of Problem H2O

A cyclic barrier is a reasonable choice for a barrier in contexts involving a
fixed sized group of threads that must occasionally wait for each other.

Now that there are three processes, one of them reads from the input string
to extract one 'O', and the other two read from the input string and each
extracts one 'H'.

In each cycle, the three threads work collaboratively to generate one H2O
molecule. Cyclic barriers are used to make the three threads wait for each
other in the process.
